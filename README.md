this virus deletes all the user data, changes the registry to desable the taskmanager the registry editor and auto starts with windows, it also makes 10 google searches but they are shortend by cutt.ly and lastly it crashes the pc opening the calculator and the file explorer and the cmd.

it also repeats messages like "try to use your files" "your pc is gonna die try to delete the virus :D" "all your files will get deleted pc optimizer" "do you still use the pc"
"use the calculator pls" and a memz reference "your pc will get fucked by death use it while you can xd :O"

as you can see it is a very rudementary virus 
the only purpose of this virus is to entretain myself and to irritate the victim (plese use it responsbly dont uset for bad)
